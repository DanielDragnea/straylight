checkCompilationsOptions.sh:
============================

    (can be invoked via 'make test' from the parent folder)
    This script will do a set of builds with different configuration options,
    and will:
        (a) verify the correctness of the results (comparing the output
            generated by the C++ code (output/stage13_1) with the one from the
            original IDL code (output.from.ESA.all.channels.stage13/stage13_1)
        (b) measure the speed of processing per frame, when the calculated
            PSF data are re-used in all frames after the first one.

elements.pl:
============

    This script extracts individual elements (one per line) from IDL logs

elementsDiff.py:
(stats.py)
================

    This script is used to compare the outputs of C++ and IDL - it is used
    in conjuction with stats.py like this:

        ./contrib/elementsDiff.py \
            output/stage13_1 \
            output.from.ESA.all.channels.stage13/stage13_1 | \
            stats.py

    ...and the report that comes out looks like this:

               Elements: 4285323
          Average value: 2.60003084948e-05
          Std deviation: 1.60640785984e-05
          Sample stddev: 1.60640804727e-05
                 Median: 2.49999999937e-05
                    Min: 0.0
                    Max: 8.80000000052e-05
           Overall: 2.60003084948e-05 +/- 61.8%

img.py:
=======

    I coded this to visualize the contents of the files - turns outs there
    wasn't much to see (they were not real images, dashed were the hopes of
    seeing something globe-like :-)

oldMakefiles:

    Before the autoconf era, the Makefiles I manually wrote to do the work.
    Kept here just in case.
